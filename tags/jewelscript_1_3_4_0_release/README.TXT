JewelScript is a general purpose, object-oriented script language that compiles
into code for a register based virtual machine. The language is quite similar to
other object-oriented high-level languages (Java, C#).

The library is entirely self-sufficient and ANSI C compliant. It's main purpose
is to be embedded in any C/C++ application to allow automation of that
application through scripting.

An integrated C++ binding code generator allows you to create bindings for your
application's classes in seconds. The integrated HTML documentation generator
allows you to create documentation for your script developers in seconds.
