This project is a simple console applicaton written in ANSI C, that demonstrates
how to embed the JewelScript library in any application. It is intended for
demonstration purposes only and may not be particularly useful for any other
purpose.

A project and solution for VC 2008 Express is included in the package, users of
other platforms unfortunately will need to create their own project / makefile.

The native bindings in /contrib/native are very old and outdated. They are only
meant for demonstration purposes. Some of the scripts in the /test folder use
them.
