### Introduction

JewelScript is a general purpose, object-oriented script language that compiles into code for a register based virtual machine. The language is quite similar to object-oriented high-level languages like Java and C#.

The library is entirely self-sufficient and ANSI C compliant. It's main purpose is to be embedded in any application to allow automation of that application through scripting.

An [integrated C++ binding code generator](http://blog.jewe.org/?p=29) allows you to create bindings for your application's classes in seconds. The [integrated HTML documentation generator](http://blog.jewe.org/?p=573) allows you to create documentation for your native bindings in seconds.

The project is released under the zlib/libpng license. It has been in development for over 10 years and offers some [powerful features](http://blog.jewe.org/?p=19).

Extensive information, documentation, articles and code examples can be found at the developer blog.
