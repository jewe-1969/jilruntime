# JILRunOnly demo application
This project is a simple console applicaton written in ANSI C, that demonstrates
how to embed JewelScript in any application. It is intended for demonstration
purposes only and may not be particularly useful for anything else.

Projects for Visual Studio 2008 Express, Visual Studio 2103 and DevC++ 5.9.2 are
included. Users of other compilers will need to create their own project.

The native bindings in `/contrib/native` are very old and outdated. They are only
meant for demonstration purposes. Some of the scripts in the `/test` folder use
them.
